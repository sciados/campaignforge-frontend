- **Campaign overview** showing active campaigns and progress status

### 3. **Campaign Creation**
- Users create campaigns with basic information (title, description, type)
- Campaign type determines available features and input types
- Initial setup creates campaign record with `'draft'` status
- Campaign gets unique ID and enters the 3-step modular workflow

### 4. **Step 1: Source Input & Intelligence Gathering**

#### Input Collection (`/campaigns/[id]/inputs`)
- **Dynamic input forms** based on user type:
  - **Affiliates**: Competitor URLs, sales pages, product descriptions
  - **Business owners**: Own website URLs, customer data, marketing materials
  - **Content creators**: Social profiles, existing content, audience data
  - **Agencies**: Client materials, brand guidelines, performance data

#### Intelligence Pipeline (3-Stage Processing)
- **Stage 1 - Base Extraction**: Raw data extraction from URLs, files, text inputs
- **Stage 2 - AI Enhancement**: Content analysis, market positioning, audience insights
- **Stage 3 - RAG Processing**: Semantic indexing, knowledge base creation, intelligent retrieval

The system runs `/api/intelligence/analyze` with:
```json
{
  "source_url": "user_provided_url",
  "analysis_method": "fast",
  "force_refresh": false
}
```

### 5. **Step 2: Intelligence Analysis & Processing**
- **Auto-analysis** extracts marketing intelligence from sources
- **Confidence scoring** (0-100%) indicates analysis quality
- **Market insights** including positioning, audience, pain points
- **Competitive analysis** when competitor URLs provided
- **Content themes** and messaging recommendations generated
- Intelligence stored in vector database for RAG retrieval

### 6. **Step 3: Content Generation**
- **Separation principle**: Intelligence gathering completed before content generation
- **Content types** based on user specialization:
  - **Email sequences** (welcome, nurture, promotional)
  - **Social media posts** (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - **Ad copy** (Google Ads, Facebook Ads)
  - **Blog content** and **sales pages**
  - **Video scripts** and **webinar outlines**

#### Enhanced Email Generation System
- **AI learning integration** analyzes past campaign performance

- **Performance metrics** tracking and optimization recommendations
- **Publishing integration** (planned) for direct social media posting
- **Version control** for content iterations and A/B testing

### 8. **Workflow State Management**
Each campaign tracks:
```typescript
{
  workflow_state: 'draft' | 'inputs_added' | 'analyzing' | 'analysis_complete' | 'generating' | 'complete',
  completion_percentage: number,
  current_step: number,
  total_steps: 4,
  auto_analysis: {
    enabled: boolean,
    status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed',
    confidence_score: number
  },
  can_generate_content: boolean
}
```
